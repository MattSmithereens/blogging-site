    <h1>Everything about my pirate blog: Blog the Plank</h1>

    <p>Here are some highlights from me blergs:</p>

    <div class="important">
      <h2>Emo Jams, bad jokes, hook hands, and wild women</h2>

      <p>What is a pirate favorite periodic element? The answer is Arrrrgon</p>

      <p>Types of <span class="emp">BLAH:</span></p>

      <ul>
        <li>too much blah</li>
        <li>too long blah</li>
        <li>not pertaining to your interests blah</li>
        <li>somewhat interesting, but you're falling asleep blah</li>
      </uL>

      <h2>Other boring stuff</h2>

      <p>errrrrrrrrrrrrrmageeeerrrrrdddd plz make it staphhhhh BLAH BLAH BLAH <span class="emp">BORING!!!!</span>.</p>
    </div>

    <p>Now, to truly lose your interest.</p>

    <div class="unimportant">
      <h2></h2>

<p>None of this matters, <span class="highlight">life is futile, everyone dies</span>. For example:
  <span class="type">YOU</span> will die, <span class="type">WE</span> will all die, <span class="type">all the animals</span> will die. The sun will burn out,<span class="highlight">even this solar system will one day be dead and all will be still</span>.</p>

      <p>Little-known fact: everything you find important and meaningful will all go away one day. Everyone you love will die, and all things are temporary, even all of the efforts put into this website</p>

      <h2>Lectures are inherently boring because anytime not doing what you actually want with free time is OPPRESSION of the mind</h2>

      <p>You are welcome, please don't self harm, let us all live long and be miserable..TOGETHER.</p>
